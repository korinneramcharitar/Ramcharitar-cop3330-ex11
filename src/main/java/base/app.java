//At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates, and youâ€™ll need to ensure your calculations are as precise as possible.
//Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have, and prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro. Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars.
//The formula for currency conversion is derived from

//How many euros are you exchanging? 81
//What is the exchange rate? 1.3751
//81 euros at an exchange rate of 1.3751 is
//111.38 U.S. dollars

//Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
//Use a single output statement.
